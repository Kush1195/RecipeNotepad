One of the most well-known of Gujarati desserts, Lapsi is a very appealing sweet dish of roasted and cooked broken wheat sweetened with sugar and flavoured pleasantly with cardamom powder. Roasting the broken wheat in ghee gives the Lapsi a rich brown colour, intense aroma and nice flavour. Although it is a traditional recipe, it has a timeless appeal and is much-loved by both adults and children. This is one of the sweets that is commonly made during festivals in Gujarati households. You can also try other such traditional sweets like the Coconut Sheera and Kaju Kopra Sheera.

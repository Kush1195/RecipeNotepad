Gujarat is known for its many snacks that are a treat to the palate even while being friendly to the stomach! here is another such easy to make and easily digestible afternoon snack that is so popular that it is even sold on the streets of gujarat. Rice khichu is so named because it has to be served really hot, when it is soft and aromatic. However, serving it in the traditional way with oodles of raw oil can turn this healthy snack into an unhealthy one. So, we suggest you shape it with an interesting mould, and top it with just a little bit oil before serving. A word of caution - when making this dish, stir in the flour quickly to avoid lumps.

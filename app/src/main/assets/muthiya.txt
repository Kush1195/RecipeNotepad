Here is another tea-time snack that is sure to please you. “muthi” means fist in gujarati, and the dish is named such because the mixture is shaped into cylindrical rolls using the fist. One thing to remember while making doodhi muthia is that bottle gourd has high water content. This water itself is sufficient to impart softness to the muthias, and it is not necessary to add any more water while making the dough.

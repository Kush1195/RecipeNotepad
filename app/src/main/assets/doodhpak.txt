Doodh paak is a semi-thick mithai, brimful with the goodness of milk. The milk is simmered for a while; then the rice is added and simmered till cooked. As the rice is cooked completely in the milk, it imbibes a luxurious flavour and aroma. The cardamom and saffron added towards the end complete the royal feel of this dish!

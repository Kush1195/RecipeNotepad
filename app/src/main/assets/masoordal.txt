Rinse the masoor dal under cold water thoroughly. Bring the water to the boil in a large saucepan. Add the dal, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add 2 tsp garam masala, 2 tsp turmeric and the salt. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the lentils are cooked through. As it cooks, keep an eye on the water level, as you don't want the lentils to dry and burn. Add water if needed. When done, turn off the heat and set aside.Heat both oils in a frying pan over low heat. Add the onions and cook for 15 minutes or until soft but not browned.Add the garlic, ginger and chopped chilli. Fry for 1 minute, then add the ground cumin, 1 tsp garam masala and the remaining 1 tsp turmeric, and fry for 2 minutes (don't let it burn). Remove 2 tbsp of the onion mixture and set aside for the garnish.

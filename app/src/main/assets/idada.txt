Idada, here is a non-fermented version of dhokla, for people with acidity and for jains. This can be made even faster than the khatta dhoklas. Also, these dhoklas are thinner and can be had for breakfast or as a snack along with green chutney or with raw oil. Urad dal increases its health quotient. If you want a quicker way out, you can use the dhokla flour that is readily available in the market, but this freshly ground rice and dal mixture makes amazing dhoklas… hence make it this way when you have leisure time. Pepper powder adds its unique flavour, so ensure that you use freshly-ground pepper. Drain the rice and blend in a mixer to a coarse paste adding water as required (approximately ¼ cup). Keep aside. Drain the urad dal and blend in a mixer to a smooth paste adding water as required (approximately 2 tbsp). Keep aside. Combine the rice and urad dal paste together in a bowl, add the ginger-green chilli paste, oil and salt and mix well. Cover and keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes.

This irresistible snack of potato patties with thick lentil gravy, garnished with sev and onions, can even serve as meal by itself! the stuffing is a little spicy, but complements the blandness of potatoes well. Also note that you don’t even have to deep-fry the patties, just shallow-fry them with little oil on a non-stick griddle. The finishing touch is the chutney streaked atop the ragda patties provides a perfect touch of sweetness and tanginess.Combine the potatoes, cornflour and salt in a bowl and mix well.Divide the potato mixture into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a 75 mm. (2 ½ ") diameter circle. Place 1 tsp of the prepared stuffing in the centre. Bring together the edges in the centre to seal the filling inside the potato circle.Repeat with the remaining potato mixture and stuffing to make 7 more stuffed patties.Cook the patties on a non-stick tava (griddle), using a little oil, till they turn brown in colour from both the sides. Keep aside.

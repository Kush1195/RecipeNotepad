The Rava Dhokla is quick and easy to make, without requiring any grinding or fermenting, yet it is as fluffy and tasty as you would expect a dhokla to be, making it an ideal dish to whip up for breakfast or evening tea-time . Just mix all the ingredients, let them rest for half an hour, and then steam the batter The tempering added on top of the dhokla after it is cooked is the master stroke, as in the case of any dhokla recipe. It gives the Semolina Dhokla a fabulous aroma and special flavour. Serve it with peppy green chutney to make a yummy snack. Dhoklas are also a good accompaniment with Aamras , Puris and Karela Bateta Nu Shaak .
